## v3.12.0 [WIP]

**Improvements**

-   Uses can zoom by pinching a trackpad

**Breaking change**

-   The `jumpToDestination` function now has only a single property. You don't have to change anything if your application doesn't have any custom plugin using the `jumpToDestination` function.

```tsx
// Before
import type { DestinationOffsetFromViewport } from '@react-pdf-viewer/core';
import { SpecialZoomLevel } from '@react-pdf-viewer/core';

jumpToDestination(
    pageIndex: number,
    bottomOffset: number | DestinationOffsetFromViewport,
    leftOffset: number | DestinationOffsetFromViewport,
    scaleTo?: number | SpecialZoomLevel
);

// After
import type { Destination } from '@react-pdf-viewer/core';

jumpToDestination(destination: Destination);
```
